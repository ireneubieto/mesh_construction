# mesh_construction
3D human models are nowadays widely used in a lot of different applications, from videogames to Instagram filters. Meshes can be constructed from scratch by different methods, but constructing meshes that replicate a real-life model is a different problem. The main objective of this project is to solve the 3D mesh construction out of a real-life model problem by developing a real-time web-based application that creates a 3D model out of a human face captured from the webcam, by using skinning algorithm. It being a browser platform makes the application within reach of everyone and with an easy-to-follow interface, only needing a webcam as an external device, which is affordable hardware.\newline In this document we cover the process we followed to achieve the goal of the project, explaining the different approaches we considered, the design of the application, and how we implemented it, making at the end an evaluation to test the quality of the implementation. Finally, we will talk about future extensions of this project and possible applications.
